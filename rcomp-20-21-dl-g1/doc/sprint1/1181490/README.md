## Building 5:

## Ground Floor:

I decided to put the HC and the IC in the same closet to reduce the space needed in the room to contain them.

I placed the HC next to the IC with the same purpose, reducing the need for fiber optic cable type multimode.

I also decided to place consolidation points in all rooms to reduce the size of the cable used and the load overload.

I decided to place the HC in room 51.1 because it is closer to the floor cable passageway, giving the possibility to access the previous floor reducing the need for fiber optic cable type multimode.

I also decided to place consolidation points in all rooms even though it will increase the size of the cable used, it will reduce the load overload.

Considering that the entire space must have access to wi-fi, I decided to strategically place 1 Access Point, at the beginning of room 51.4 being possible to cover the entire floor.
