- Each room has a Consolidation Point since there are multiples outlets in every room;
- The Access Points channels are:
    - Channel 1 in the AP in the left, next to room 30.4;
    - Channel 6 in the AP in the middle;
    - Channel 11 in the AP in the far right;
    > To make sure neither the APs interfere with each other the only channels used are 1, 6 and 11
- On the open right area:
    - To make sure that in every spot is reachable to an outlet outlets were added on the floor;
    - Each Consolidation Point is connected to a portion of the outlets both suspended and on the floor;
