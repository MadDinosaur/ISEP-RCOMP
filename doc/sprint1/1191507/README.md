## Disclaimer

The number of outlets in a work space is always rounded up after calculation according to the *ratio of two outlets per 10 sq. meters* rule.

The unit of measure of Telecommunications Enclosures is considered to be *1U = 1 CAT6A 24 ports patch panel*. Also, all TE have a 50% oversize to accomodate future upgrades.

## Building 1 - Ground Floor

Outside network connection is directed through ceiling cable passeway to the datacenter on the floor above (IC).
Cabling from IC is redirected back to this floor and into the HC. There are CP on 10.2 and 10.3 due to the high outlet density (close to 24 or greater).
